## Standard Features

In addition to the Canary Framework itself, there are numerous bundled, standard features present in the project.
These features are implementations of the Canary API itself in the form of a few [Monitors](adding-a-monitor.html),
[Notification Agents](adding-a-notification-agent.html), and a JCR implementation of a
[Record Persistence Services](adding-a-persistence-service.html).

All of these features (except the JCR Persistence Manager) require a present [`sling:OsgiConfig`](http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/deploying/configuring_osgi.html)
 (see "OSGi Configuration in the Repository") in order to come online, be functional. Some features require parameters,
  which are defined in their specific configurations (see below). Otherwise a default configuration can and should be used.

## Monitors

1. [Blocked Agent Queue Monitor](groovydoc/com/citytechinc/aem/canary/services/monitor/BlockedAgentQueueMonitor.html) - Examines all the configured replication agents, looking for blocked replication queues.
This monitor polls every 10 seconds and requires 2 minutes of failed polls before failing. Requires parameters:
    * `agentIds` - a list of strings which defaults to include 'publish'

2. [Log Listener Exception Collecting Monitor](groovydoc/com/citytechinc/aem/canary/services/monitor/LogListenerExceptionCollectingMonitor.html) - Collects exception information and reports back when polled. This monitor
 polls every 10 seconds and requires 2 minutes of failed polls before failing. Requires parameters:
    * `scrutinizedPackagePaths` - a list of strings which represent packages and is empty by default.
     If the list contains no values, it will report all exceptions
    * `exceptionReportingThreshold` - an integer indicating a threshold required for a failed poll response

3. [Sling Event Job Monitor](groovydoc/com/citytechinc/aem/canary/services/monitor/SlingEventJobMonitor.html) - Polls the sling [Job Manager](https://sling.apache.org/apidocs/sling6/org/apache/sling/event/jobs/JobManager.html)
 comparing the reported average wait and process times to the configured threshold limit. This monitor polls every
  10 seconds and requires 2 minutes of failed polls before failing. Requires parameters:
    * `averageProcessingTimeThreshold` - The average processing time threshold limit to exceed for an alarm
    * `averageWaitingTimeThreshold` - The average waiting time threshold limit to exceed for an alarm

## Notification Agents

1. [Email Notification](groovydoc/com/citytechinc/aem/canary/services/notification/EmailNotificationAgent.html) - sends emails to a configured list of recipients from one sender using the
 [CQ MailService](http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/javadoc/com/day/cq/mailer/MailService.html). The CQ MailService
 dependency is required and if not met, this Notification Agent will be unsatisfied. Requires parameters:
    * `fromEmail` - the from e-mail address
    * `toEmailAddresses` - a list of strings which represent the 'to receive' e-mail addresses

2. [Log Escalation Notification Agent](groovydoc/com/citytechinc/aem/canary/services/notification/LogEscalationNotificationAgent.html) - creates a configuration entry via the
[Configuration Admin](http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/cm/ConfigurationAdmin.html) for the Monitor.
This agent will also clean up after itself when alarms are cleared.

## Persistence Services

1. [JCR Persistence Manager](groovydoc/com/citytechinc/aem/canary/services/persistence/JCRPersistenceManager.html) - responsible for persisting and retrieving Monitor records from the JCR.
